Login with your Gmail to read and write emails. Click the Help button or the h key for help and keyboard shortcuts.

kumo can be used from Firefox or Google Chrome on your computer or Google Chrome on your smartphone. This website is acessible according to WAVE standards and compatible with a screen reader (i.e. Apple's VoiceOver).

I think I can still improve the functionality for a screen reader.
